**Synopsis:**

The objective of this machine learning project is to build
classification models to predict rainfall in Australia for the following
day based on weather metrics from the current day. The dataset used for
this project contains observations of weather metrics for each day from
2008 to 2017, sourced from the Australian Government\'s Bureau of
Meteorology. The dataset includes various weather parameters such as
temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, and direction, among
others.

**Project Overview:**

1.  **Importing Data:** The dataset is imported using the pandas
    library.

2.  **Data Preprocessing:**

    -   One Hot Encoding: Categorical variables like \'RainToday\',
        \'WindGustDir\', \'WindDir9am\', and \'WindDir3pm\' are
        converted into binary variables using one-hot encoding.

    -   The target variable \'RainTomorrow\' is transformed into binary
        values (0 for \'No\' and 1 for \'Yes\').

    -   Features and target variable are separated.

3.  **Model Building:**

    -   **Linear Regression:** A Linear Regression model is trained and
        evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared
        Error, and R2-score.

    -   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A KNN model with k=4 neighbors is
        trained and evaluated using accuracy score, Jaccard Index,
        F1-score, and Log Loss.

    -   **Decision Tree:** A Decision Tree classifier with a maximum
        depth of 4 is trained and evaluated using the same metrics as
        KNN.

    -   **Logistic Regression:** A Logistic Regression model with a
        regularization parameter (C=0.01) and solver set to
        \'liblinear\' is trained and evaluated using accuracy score,
        Jaccard Index, F1-score, and Log Loss.

    -   **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A linear SVM model is trained
        and evaluated using the same metrics as Logistic Regression and
        KNN.

4.  **Report Generation:** The evaluation metrics for all models are
    compiled into a tabular format for easy comparison.

**Model Evaluation:**

The models are evaluated based on their performance metrics such as
accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1-score, and Log Loss. The SVM model exhibits
the highest accuracy score and Jaccard Index, indicating its
effectiveness in predicting rainfall in Australia. However, it\'s
essential to consider all metrics comprehensively to select the most
suitable model for deployment.

This project provides insights into the application of classification
algorithms in weather prediction, demonstrating their effectiveness in
analysing complex datasets and making informed predictions. Further
improvements and optimizations can be made by exploring advanced
algorithms and feature engineering techniques.
